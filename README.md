# Name
- OneDrive

# Description
  - The project is a clone of OneDrive.
  - User experience:
    - The user can create a new profile or login to an existing one.
    - If he already has an account when he opens the application he is asked if he wants to sync the data from server to its computer.
    - If he dosen't have an account he has to create one and automatically the application creates a folder for him to put the files that he wants to be
    uploaded on server
    - When he adds a new file in the folder automatically the application uploads the file on the server.
  - How it works:
    - The application communicates with the server thorugh  via  a TCP port.
    - The network part is made with winsockets.
